<div id="a-pragmatic-guide-for-analysis-with-crawl" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> A Pragmatic Guide for Analysis with <code>crawl</code></h1>
<p>The <code>crawl</code> package is designed and built with the idea that it should be accessible and useful to a research biologist with some intermediate R skills and an understanding of the basic statistical theory behind the analysis of animal movement. This portion of the book will focus on providing the user with suggested principles, workflows, and pragmatic approaches that, if followed, should make analysis with <code>crawl</code> more efficient and reliable.</p>
<p>This content is broken up in the following sections:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Analysis and Coding Principles</li>
<li>Assembling Source Data</li>
<li>Tidy Data for Telemetry</li>
<li>Preparing Input Data for <code>crawl</code></li>
<li>Determining Your Model Parameters</li>
<li>Exploring and Troubleshooting Model Results</li>
<li>Predicting a Movement Track</li>
<li>Simulating Tracks from the Posterior</li>
<li>Visualization of Results</li>
</ol>
<div id="analysis-and-coding-principles" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Analysis and Coding Principles</h2>
<p>As with anything in science and R, there are a number of right ways to approach a problem. The workflows and principles outline here aren’t the only way to use <code>crawl</code>. However, this content has been developed after years of working with researchers and troubleshooting common issues. For most users, following this guide will prove a successful endeavor. More advanced users or those with specific needs should feel free to refer to this as a starting point but then expand to meet their need.</p>
<div id="source-data-are-read-only" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Source Data are Read Only</h3>
<p>Source data should not be edited. In many cases, the financial and personal investment required to acquire these data is significant. In addition, the unique timing, location, and nature of the data cannot be replicated so every effort should be employed to preserve the integrity of source data as they were collected. All efforts should be made to also insure that source data are stored in plain text or well described open formats. This approach provides researchers confidence that data will be available and usable well into the future.</p>
</div>
<div id="script-everything" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Script Everything</h3>
<p>In all likelihood, the format of any source data will not be condusive to established analytical procedures. For example, <code>crawl</code> cannot accept a raw data file downloaded from ArgosWeb or the Wildlife Computers Data Portal. Some amount of data carpentry is required. Keeping with the principles of reproducibility, all data assembly and carpentry should be scripted. Here, we rely on the R programming language for our scripts, but Python or other similar languages will also meet this need.</p>
</div>
<div id="document-along-the-way" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Document Along the Way</h3>
<p>Scripting the data assembly should be combined with an effort to properly document the process. Documentation is an important component of reproducibility and, if done as part of the scritping and development process, provides an easier workflow for publishing results and data to journals and repositories. The <code>rmarkdown</code>, <code>bookdown</code>, and <code>knitr</code> packages provide an excellent framework for combining your R scripts with documentation. This entire book is written with <code>bookdown</code> and <code>knitr</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="embrace-the-tidyverse" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.4</span> Embrace the Tidyverse</h3>
<p>The <em>tidyverse</em> describes a set of R packages developed by, or in association with, Hadley Wickham. Tidy data principles are outlined in a 2014 <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10">paper</a> published in the <em>Journal of Statistical Software</em>. The key tennants of tidy data are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each variable forms a column.</li>
<li>Each observation forms a row.</li>
<li>Each type of observational unit forms a table.</li>
</ol>
<p>Location data from telemetry deployments often follows this type of structure: each location estimate is a row and the columns all represent variable attributes associated with that location. Additionally, the location data are usually organized into a single table. Behavior data, however, often comes in a less structured format. Different behavior type data are sometimes mixed within a single table and column headings do not consistently describe the same variable (e.g. <em>Bin1</em>, <em>Bin2</em>, etc). There are valid reasons for tag vendors and data providers to transmit the source data in this way, but the structure is not condusive to analysis.</p>
<p>The <code>tidyverse</code> package is a wrapper for a number of separate packages that each contribute to the tidy’ing of data. The <code>tidyr</code>, <code>dplyr</code>, <code>readr</code>, and <code>purrr</code> packages are key components. In addition, the <code>lubridate</code> package (not included in the <code>tidyverse</code> package) is especially useful for consistent maninpulation of date-time values.</p>
</div>
<div id="anticipate-errors-trap-them" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.5</span> Anticipate Errors &amp; Trap Them</h3>
<p>Use R’s error trapping functions (<code>try()</code> and <code>tryCatch()</code>) in areas of your code where you anticipate parsing errors or potential issues with convergence or fit. The <code>purrr::safely()</code> function also provides a great service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="assembling-source-data" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Assembling Source Data</h2>
<p>Where and how you access the source data for your telemetry study will depend on the type of tag and vendor. Argos location data is available to users from the Argos website and many third party sites and respositories (e.g. movebank, sea-turtle.org) have API connections to ArgosWeb that can faciliate data access. Each tag manufacturer often has additional data streams included within the Argos transmission that require specific software or processing to translate. Both the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) and Wildlife Computers provide online data portals that provide users access to the location and additional sensor data.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the data are retrieved, these files should be treated as read only and not edited. ArgosWeb and vendors have, typically, kept the data formats and structure consistent over time. This affords end users the ability to develop custom processing scripts without much fear the formats will change and break their scripts.</p>
<div id="read-in-csv-source-data" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Read In CSV Source Data</h3>
<p>Here we will demonstrate the development of such a script using data downloaded from the Wildlife Computers data portal. All data are grouped by deployment and presented in various comma-separated files. The <code>*-Locations.csv</code> contains all of the Argos location estimates determined for the deployment. At a minimum, this file includes identifying columns such as <code>DeployID</code>, <code>PTT</code>, <code>Date</code>, <code>Quality</code>, <code>Type</code>, <code>Latitude</code>, and <code>Longitude</code>. If the Argos Kalman filtering approach has been enabled (which it should be for any modern tag deployment), then additional data will be found in columns that describe the error ellipses (e.g. <code>Error Semi-major axis</code>, <code>Error Semi-minor axis</code>, <code>Error Ellipse orientation</code>). Note, if the tag transmitted GPS/FastLoc data, this file will list those records as <code>Type = 'FastGPS'</code>.</p>
<p>The other file of interest we will be working with is an example <code>*-Histos.csv</code>. These files include dive and haul-out behavior data derived from sensors on the tag. Most notably, the pressure transducer (for depth) and the salt-water switch (for determining wet/dry status). We will focus on processing this file to demonstrate how we can properly <em>tidy</em> our data.</p>
<p>We will rely on the <code>tidyverse</code> set of packages plus <code>purrr</code> and <code>lubridate</code> to make reading and processing these files easier and more reliable.</p>

<span class="kw">library</span>(purrr)
<span class="kw">library</span>(lubridate)</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>readr</code> includes the <code>read_csv()</code> function which we will rely on to read the csv data into R.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r">path_to_file &lt;-<span class="st"> &quot;examples/data/160941-Locations.csv&quot;</span>

</div>
<div id="specify-column-data-types" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Specify Column Data Types</h3>
<p>The <code>readr::read_csv()</code> function tries to interpret the proper data types for each of the columns and provides us the column specifications it determined. In most cases, the function gets this correct. However, if we examine the <code>cols()</code> specification selected, we see that the <code>Date</code> column was read in as a <em>character</em> data type.</p>
<p>To correct this, we need to provide our own <code>cols()</code> specification. We can do this by simply modifying the specification <code>readr::read_csv()</code> provided us. In this case, we want the <code>Date</code> column to rely on <code>col_datetime</code> and to parse the character string using the format <code>%H:%M:%S %d-%b-%Y</code>.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Tidy Data for Telemetry</h2>
<p>A key tennat of tidy data is that each row represents a single observation. For location data, regardless of the data source, this is typical of the source data structure. Each line in a file usually represents a single location estimate at a specific time. So, there’s very little we need to do in order to get our <code>tbl_locs</code> into an acceptable structure.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Standard Column Names</h3>
<p>One thing we can do, is to adjust the column names so there are no spaces or hyphens. We can also drop everything to lower-case to avoid typos. To do this we will create our own function, <code>make_names()</code>, which expands on the base function <code>make.names()</code>. We also want to change the <code>date</code> column to a more appropriate and less confusing <code>date_time</code>.</p>

<p>At this point, our <code>tbl_locs</code> is pretty tidy and, other than a few final steps, ready for input into the <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code> function. The <code>*-Histos.csv</code> file, however, has a messy, horizontal structure and will require some tidying. The <code>tidyr</code> package has a number of options that will help us. But, first let’s look closer at the structure of a typical <code>*-Histos.csv</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="tidy-a-messy-histos-file" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Tidy a Messy ‘Histos’ File</h3>
<p>Wildlife Computers provides a variety of data types within this file structure. Because the details of each data type are subject to tag programming details, the data structure places observations into a series of <code>Bin1, Bin2, ..., Bin72</code> columns. What each <code>Bin#</code> column represents depends on the data type and how the tags were programmed. For instance, a <code>Dive Depth</code> record represents the number of dives with a maximum depth within the programmed depth bin range. <code>Time At Depth (TAD)</code> represents the number of seconds spent within a particular programmed depth bin range. Each record represents a period of time that is also user programmable.</p>
<p>While this <em>messy</em> data structure is an efficient way of delivering the data to users, it violates the principles of tidy data strucutes and presents a number of data management and analysis challenges. We are going to focus on a process for tidying the <code>Percent</code> or <code>1Percent</code> timeline data as this information can be incorporated into the <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code> model fit. The same approach should be adopted for other histogram record types and the <code>wcUtils</code> <a href="https://github.com/jmlondon/wcUtils">package</a> provides a series of helper functions developed specifically for this challenge.</p>
<p>The <code>Percent</code>/<code>1Percent</code> timeline data are presented within the <code>*-Histos.csv</code> file structure as 24-hour observations — each record represents a 24-hour UTC time period. Within the record, each <code>Bin#</code> represents an hour of the day from <code>00</code> through <code>23</code>. The values recorded for each <code>Bin#</code> column represent the percentage of that hour the tag was dry (out of the water). This data structure violates the tidy principles of requiring each record represent a single observation and that each column represent a single variable.</p>
<p>Let’s start by reading the data in to R with <code>readr::read_csv()</code> as before. Note, we again rely on a custom <code>cols()</code> specification to insure data types are properly set. And, since we are only interested in <code>Bin</code> columns 1:24, we will select out the remaining columns.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Gathering Data with <code>tidyr</code></h3>
<p>Now that our percent timeline data are in R, we can work to tidy the data structure using the <code>tidyr::gather()</code> function. This function requires that we provide character names for the <em>key</em> and <em>value</em> columns to create. We then specify which columns will be <em>gathered</em> into those key-value paired columns. In this case, our new columns will be <code>bin</code> and <code>percent_dry</code> and we will <em>gather</em> the values from all of the columns that start with the character string <em>bin</em>.</p>
<p>Since we know that each <code>bin</code> column reprents an hour of the day, we can also improve our data structure by changing the value of <code>date_hour</code> (note we rename <code>date</code> to <code>date_hour</code>) to reflect this. We accomplish this by creating a simple lookup table (tibble) that relates each <code>bin</code> column to the hour of day it represents. The <code>dplyr::left_join()</code> function is used to match and merge this with our <code>tbl_percent</code> and then we add the <code>hour</code> value to each <code>date_hour</code> value with the <code>dplyr::mutate()</code> and <code>lubridate::hours()</code> functions.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Preparing Input Data for <code>crawl</code></h2>
<p>At this point, the <code>tbl_locs</code> object represents the minimal source data required to fit <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code>. In addition to including location estimates in the model fit, one can also include an <em>activity</em> parameter. For harbor seals, we can rely on the percent-timeline data as an indicator of activity — when the tags are dry for most of an hour, the seal is likely hauled out and not moving. The <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code> will interpret this as an indication that the auto-correlation parameter should go to zero.</p>
<p>In this section, we will prepare two input objects for <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code>. The first will be a spatial object of location estimates that can be passed directly. The second, will be a data.frame that represents a merge between the location estimates and percent-timeline data.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.1</span> Error Parameters for GPS Data</h3>
<p>Many tags deployed on marine animals now include the option to collect GPS quality location esimates in addition to Argos. <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code> relies on the ellipse error parameters provide by Argos, so we need to fill in the GPS locations with appropriate values. GPS locations from these tags are generally expected to have an error radius of ~50m as long as the number of satellites used for the estimate is greater than 4. Below, we will use the <code>dplyr::mutate()</code> function to fill in these values. While we are at it, we will also remove any <em>Argos</em> records that do not have associated error ellipse values.</p>

<p>In many cases, researchers are also knowledgable of the time and location coordinates of animal release.

In general, it is best to over estimate this error radius. This record should be the first location record in the dataset passed to <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.3</span> Course Speed Filter</h3>
<p>This step is optional, but it is very common for Argos data to include obviously wrong locations (locations that are 100s of kilometers away from the study area). Including such obviously wrong locations in the analysis can result in unexpected issues or problems fitting. For this reason, we recommend a course speed filter to remove these obviously wrong locations. A typical speed filter might use a value of 2.5 m/s as a biologically reasonable value for pinnipeds. For this application, we will use 7.5 m/s and rely on the <code>argosfilter</code> package.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.4.4</span> Create a Spatial Object</h3>
<p>There are now two package frameworks within R for describing spatial data: <code>sp</code> and <code>sf</code>. The <code>sp</code> package has been the defacto standard for spatial data in R and has widespread support in a number of additional packages. The <code>sf</code> package is new and still in active development. However, the <code>sf</code> package is based on the more open <em>simple features</em> standard for spatial data. For this reason, and others, many in the R community feel <code>sf</code> is the future of spatial data in R.</p>
<p>The <code>crawl::crwMLE()</code> can accept either a <em>SpatialPointsDataFrame</em> from the <code>sp</code> package or an <em>sf</em> data.frame of <em>POINT</em> geometry types. Here, we will focus on the <code>sf</code> package.</p>
